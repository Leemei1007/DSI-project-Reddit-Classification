this ip and hopefully some form of course correctit s too late for the first film and i have no idea what the animated film will entail but the sequel can still be a franchise starter so i m not just gonna say what they did wrong because that ship has sailed and everything wrong with the first movie is super apparent and obvious to even the most basic of viewers lol where is geeta instead i figured why not just help them make a sequel so here it goes part at the end of the first film we see that omari hardwick s character vanderohe is heading to mexico city via plane let s start here before the plane can safely land it crashes in the centre of mexico city how it crashed and why it crashed are unknown i figure this was the plan for the sequel anyway reports of a zombie outbreak like no other start to come in people are turning fast and the mexican government is overwhelmedthe mexican government is forced to turn to america for help amp guidance seeing as they ve already dealt with a situation like thisdue to the events of the first film the american government had refined and developed a form of quarantine aptly named the trump card lol yes it s on the nose but come on it s a zombie movie the trump card is initiated and helicopters sent from america to mexico airlift an attachable wall that can be dropped around cities mass landscapesviola now we have the staging area part mexico city has been walled off the mexican and american government are keeping a close eye on the city from afar in case of survivors and to document behavioural patterns there is not i repeat not a refugee camp just outside the wall the city is walled off and the military is keeping hour guard nearby cities within a mile radius or whatever outside of the quarantine zone have been evacuated soon reports of a new alpha omari emergethis alpha is unlike the other one he does not bargain and unlike the initial alpha zombie he does not care about who he chooses to change not change as far as this alpha is concerned everyone and everything is fair game this alpha is amassing an armyunlike with the first quarantine zone there have been reports of what sounds like heavy machinery coming out from the zone at night this should be impossible as far as we the government know zombies can t operate machineryreports confirm that this alpha has a very specific structure a routine almost there are four female zombies he sees frequently the government has named them the hen party he always has at least one hen at his side two of which are wearing stewardess outfits the two females on the plane with omari more reports confirm that there is a human child alive in the city yes this is our goal not money a human female child this human has been seen with the alphamore reports and further studying confirms a few details about the infection how it works and why we might see different infection rates amp amp a person s white blood cells can fend off the zombie virus depending on age general fitness and genetics a human can fend off the zombie virus if alive for several days still doesn t explain how omari survived the nuclear fallout lol but i m trying here they made this hard also where is geeta if a person dies the virus takes hold almost immediately essentially when batista turned he was bitten then died then turned immediately because his body s defences were weakened by death not the bite alone think the walking dead not everyone bitten by an alpha becomes an alpha in the first movie it s suggested straight out said that when an alpha bites you you re an alpha but this should not be the case especially since the initial outbreak in the first film showed us an alpha caused the outbreak so by that logic all the zombies we saw should ve been alphas again though this is all dependent on a person s geneticsanyways enough with that these bits are just to help correct some of the world building part reports of a young girl about years old within the quarantine zone hanging out with the alpha turn out to be true the girl maria is the daughter of one of the most powerful men in mexico you can go two ways cartel boss or government official i like cartel so i m going there plus it makes some of the later stuff more fun i apologise in advanced to my mexican brothers for being so clich the cartel boss lives in mexico city but he was away in lol pick somewhere at the time of the plane crash and subsequent zombie attack by the time he got back to mexico the city had been quarantined and he was told that maria was most likely deadregardless he held out hope and bribed personnel in every corner of the government so that if even a whiff of information about his daughter arose he would be the first to knowhe finds out pictures show that his daughter is alive somewhere inside the quarantine zone and she is being carted around by the alpha like a pet no like something he cherishes behaviour never seen in this or any other alpha before humans to them are food fodder a tool but this alpha protects a child why the government digs around and discovers the alphas identity a background check on the alpha omari shows he had a daughter that died in the las vegas outbreak that s why he was so cold in the first film but an alpha showing feelings that s never been seen before keep in mind we as the audience saw the alpha baby but the government and normal people never actually saw this to them alpha s do not care about children human or otherwise the cartel boss is furious he can t understand why the government hasn t approached him el presidente was paid a hefty fee to pass on any information the second he received itthe cartel boss realises he was boxed out him knowing would only cause a rift within the cartels it s his daughter he d go in himself to save her but while he was away there s no telling what would happen in the streets the cartels would run amuck you see with mexico city quarantined and the ten mile radius surrounding it being evacuated there was limited space to work with after the mexico city outbreak a rift formed and cartels fought each other for whatever space they could get and he has the mostel presidente thought it best to keep him in the dark he doesn t want another cartel war too much is at stakethe cartel boss wants to go and get his daughter himself but his two main advisors maldito amp diablo agree with el presidente they know the cartel boss leaving now will only destroy the organisation he needs to send in a teammaldito amp diablo send out feelers money for a job inside the quarantine zone first they offer no one bites then still no one eventually they re forced up to two teams are crazy enough to go inpart the two teams are vastly different this will give the audience time to see two very different styles of zombie killersthe first team is a rag tag band of psychopaths that are addicted to killing they survived mexico city in a big way killing their way out as they scorched the very earth they stood onthe second team elite military they use silencers advanced breaching tactics and they operate in the shadows they snuck their way out of mexico quietly dispatching every zombie in their way as they did part maldito and diablo let the boss know that two teams have responded and the cartel boss wants them both sent in for a better chance of successmaldito and diablo fill in the two teams separately the first team is given passage into the quarantine zone via some paid off military personnel and the second team opts to enter the city beneath through the seweroh and as a fun titbit make it so the first team actually accepted the they heard about the job late for some reason and has no idea how much the second team is getting they just wanna kill zombies so was a cool amount eventually it should surface that they could ve made more i dunno might make for a chucklesorry where was i okay so now we have two teams one accompanied by maldito amp the other by diablo as a way to poke fun at the failures of not immediately dispatching someone who was so clearly going to betray them in the first film team two should be accompanied by diablo who they immediately kill once the coast is clear and yes he was going to kill them once they found the boss s daughter so it was the right call part chaos ensues the first team is loud and proud drawing the zombies out and mowing them down the second team is quiet they stay off the streets moving into and through buildings as they make their way to the alpha neither team is aware of the other until much later on also this should allow for some super quiet spooky zombie killing moments for the second team while showing the first team brutalise their way through hordes with whacky make shift weaponsboth teams kill a hen but the first team isn t able to stop the hen from screaming omari is made aware humans are in his kngdom the noises we were hearing at night coming from the quarantine zone well they were making him a saw that s right this alpha is smart enough to get the other alphas to buildhe uses the saw and it is awesome an alpha wielding saw maniaci ll stop thereoh but also if you want some subtext that will work well with the idea i ve laid out well obviously there s the conversation on immigration it s a literal wall in mexico provided by america then you have the conversation on drugs cartels happening outside the wall then finally the conversation of a fathers love in that omari has found a surrogate daughter in his second life as a zombie and that the cartel boss is willing to sacrifice it all to save his daughter fathers and sacrifice similarly to the first film i guessif you want to embrace the insane then a simple paradox subplot could be added like the nuclear bomb going off and the radiation emitted mixing with the original alpha s blood corpse has created an endless paradox in which the same team is repeating the same heist but in honesty i don t think it s necessary and would require some dialogue centring on aliens robotsanyways you get the point i think the setup would work to allow for a lot of fun action something that was sorely missing in the first one oh and the movie should start at the recruitment stage i ve just filled in some background stuff that doesn t require much screen time and can be divulged in general conversation yes i ve written some general dialogue for this out of boredom i know i m lame seriously though if you like this idea please link it to zack snyder and the people at netflix so they can take the idea and run with it also if you do run with it invite me to be a zombie extra i think it d work but what about you fellow redditors does it work anything to add i m all ears i recon it d take about to months to write a competent script with little leaps in logic to make it work so i m sure they can find an actual screen writer capable of doing it in less time and with better developed themes and undertones amp anyways it s late i m rambling and this took me like minutes i m going to bed lol thanks for reading if you made it all the way through,netflix,dear zack snyder amp netflix

blown away why she won,there is so much hate for this woman it is painful to watch or stand by and not say anything about it when she won i felt like there was hope in the world the does indeed represent the odd the weird basically the autistic people out there i don t know if she is aware of this but she screams autism to me and it s i could so easily identify with her as annoying as she can possibly be all i read and heard in the comments and people s hatred of her was because of how she presents herself and it s killing me to be judged not for your art but precisely for the social abilities that you genetically lack is just a self fulfilling prophecy and it s disgusting this woman is pouring creativity out of her so naturally and so oddly it s just incredible in my own autism i tend to be as objective as i can and especially with contests like these i love to try to predict who ll win based solely on exactly the given criteria and she got my attention from the very beginning it s that kind of art art students are killing themselves to pretent doing or embodying whereas she s just that without trying she s not trying to be quirky or weird or see potatoes as beautiful she actually does see these things as beautiful for her the stuff she made is her version of a rembrandt and that is art while most people try to be artsy and try to do weird stuff for the sake of weirdness or give the people what they want when they want it autistic people simply do not belong to that universe all together we don t understand your social life nor why everyone is pretending to love each other when actually everyone is just waiting for the opportunity to stab you int he back we have our own world which is simple and direct and sure maybe loud especially autistic women tend to be exactly like deborrah loud in your face seemingly arrogant and obnoxious and a complete pain in the arse but if you re autistic yourself what you see is the real her which is this super sensitive woman with an immese inner world that just waits to burst outside and out of that excitement literally all the wrong words come out the exactly wrong way but that s ok because we re here to judge her artwork and it is exquisite are you kidding me when i saw that tacco stand i just wanted one for myself out of everything everyone has ever done that is geniunely the only thing i would actually buy and it would be the talk of every party for the rest of days and those potatoes find me one single human neurotypical out there who would have ever thought of spoiled potatoes in the fridge with sprouts coming out of them as beautiful as flowers no one which is exactly why i hoped she would win not because she s autistic as crazy and would represent us out there but because she s genius and if i were to give s spot in a museum of glas art i would want to see what she will make out of it i m sorry i actually want to buy stuff from janusz because my autism also means i m obsessed to perfection and technique but when it comes to art not so much yes he is exquisite i mean breathtaking in his craftsmanship which is why i would love one of those reticello cups or bottles but sadly he s not a complete artist he doesn t have a vision of his own he s talent lies in his craft alone so his works are the kind that super wealthy people would buy to have exquisite and luxury cups or bottles and plates whereas she can make a proper installation and just look at how she s evolved since exactly like i would have expected she went on to make great art which she already was and he went on to make more reticelli glasware and highly impressive technical things say you wouldn t put a violin luthier on the stage you d want the violinist i feel like people don t understand the difference well enough and are so pissed that he lost even though by the end of it he was literally out of ideas all together and deborrah was just getting started so this is the perfect analogy you have painting restorer who are incredibile technicians i mean literally they have to study every technique every major paintor has ever used ever so obviouly their technical level is beyond that of any painter by any means necessary but they lack the vision to do something new or something at all really and why should they the restorers that i have personally met seemed faar happier people than the painters i ve met who are also running out of ideas of what else to paint and so on so it is so rare to have someone like deborrah where ideas and art just flow through her not everything is everyone s taste but why should it and why should any real artist have to pass some highschool american popularity contest grow up if you can t see the quality of someone s work because you re blindsighted by their weird personality your perceived arrogance or whatever it may be that is literally your problem and closedmindedness and it is sad because you re missing out of great stuff and ps all exceptional artists who were autistic and by god most of them were were completely bunkers and not because it s a staple of being a great artist but simply because autistic people and neurotypicals speak very different languages what may seem to you as totally obnoxious and arrogant it may seem to me as rather insecure and fragile also most of the stuff she says is almost echolaic like she portrays specific traits of specific humans that are easy to hate but don t even come from her to begin with it s just that the situation is very overwhealming and you re put on the spot light and your autistic brain just goes blank so what do you do you ll grab the first character that comes to mind that seemed to be a similar situation and use that character as a means to communicate something whatever it may be and yes she yells at the interns but so do you yell at autistic people all these hate comments and now a petition against deborrah is literally just that a hate an autism because you don t get it so imagine having helpers who are all autistic and who don t immediately get what you re saying and this while working with molten glass you know the stuff where you literally have a split second time to make a decision and act on it so sure do you think she would have had the time to sit everyone down and say look let s put the basis for a good communication language between us again i doubt she even knows she s on the spectrum let alone understand the implications because and yes this is true her generation doesn t exist on the spectrum at that time only men got autism and only the rainman kind of men so you have an entire generation of especially women autistic who had to live their lives always thinking it s their fault never understand social language and navigating that world for reference again imagine the whole world was full of autistic people except for you and you think in your head you re normal and you know you are but no body is seeing or hearing it because all they see is this arrogant piece of dirt who is condescending and annoying that s her life and now people want to take this win away from her even

army of the dead is terrible stop letting zach snyder write he rips off other movies half the time , here s a list of movies it ripped off ocean s acceptable since that was the whole selling point just starting out weak aliens basically the entire real plot down to the corporate traitor except it doesn t make any sense why he s betraying anyone and the you don t see them screwing each other over line revenant bear scene but with a zombie tiger side note why did the tiger just lay down on a car and yawn after the king zombie ordered them to avenge his dead queen and baby side side note glowing zombie baby predator this is a little more acceptable cause it s probably been used in other movies but the whole i m probably gonna die cause this is a monster and i m just a buff dude but let s do this hand to hand thing at the end with the king zombie and omari s character bvs bulletproof cowl literally just ripped off his own movie so i guess that s okay but jeez i just called the king zombie batman after seeing that riddick zombies that come out only when it rains even though it never happened i m still putting it there cause this movie deserves no good will indiana jones seriously why does a casino vault have boobytraps isn t that a little unsafe for the regular workers and a little illegal to premeditate murder even if it s to protect something volcano this is reaching but if you remember that old volcano movie with tommy lee jones there s a seen where a firefighter saves a child but jumping into lava and then throwing her here in the last part of the montage bautista s soldier comrade is running with the little girl when she gets overwhelmed except for some reason after saving the girl she decides to go back and hug this otherwise random soldier she just met and then they drop a cargo box in their heads i am legend the whole idea of the there being a zombie king and queen couple and attacking the group cause he wanted her back to avenge her other stuff i hated kate she sucked and if you don t know why you didn t watch the moviegeeta decided to blind herself by staring at a nuclear explosion instead of helping kill the kung fu king zombie in the helicopter with themthe german safecracker why did they even need him shouldn t tanaka know the combination to his own safe if he lost it in vegas somehow they dont mention that other than him being seemingly unnecessary he also is super annoying screaming like a teen girl might be funny to some people but it made me want him to die and the fact he paused that whole slo mo music video section to ask how to kill a zombie how to kill a zombie just made me hate him from the beginningthey didn t save that girl after she had the most awesome heartpounding scene in the movie seriously that made me hate them all and the worst part is the guy who was friends with her the guy who was closest to her and the guy who in the planning scene got all up in the dude who chicken d out s face about not wanting to go just stood there and watched and then blew her up when she got bitthey kept bringing people last minute even though they couldn t possibly all fit in the helicopter with the money first kate but then the only reason kate came was to get geeta so we re already assuming extras then the coyote girl just walks up to the rapist guard and seduces him into coming to so that s extra bodies somehow fitting on that helicopter with the whole team and all the money at not point does anyone question it i almost wish they all made it just to see them try and clown car it out of therethe traitor dude humping the zombie queen before decapitating her zach snyder has a rape fetish you can t change my mindthe robot zombies don t have much to say other than why not even a why just a why i honestly forgot and now that i remember them i don t really have any hatred just why the inciting incident the whole idea of road head causing the zombie apocalypse just doesn t sound good when you say it out loud also why didn t the soldiers who were tasked with protecting the truck take one for the team instead of letting their cargo and fellow soldiers die i get he was a crap soldier who wasn t paying attention but that just makes it worse so don t bother defending it and how d that dude lose a tooth from swerving into sand the time loop thing idk if that s ever gonna be explained but it s dumb what s could the point of that possibly be seems like the loop was broken by the end if there ever was one cause omari s character is now gonna infect the worldbautista s love interest she wasn t bad herself the issue is i forgot she existed until the very end when she s flirting with bautista and then dies when i saw her i thought she was the awesome lady who they didn t save after jumping out the window like wait didn t she die why are you flirting with her what s going on the offering what was the point of that why do zombies just let people walk around if you throw them a person the queen should ve ridden on the zombie tiger like the king did the horse and just captured them all and why did they turn the rapist guard immediately but keep the women around i d say it was so they could be saved but they all diedthat chris stuckmann didn t make a hilariocity out of this seriously man i was looking forward to that stuff i liked the action it was good thanks for not completely sucking moviethe zombie tiger probably the best character in the film i wish he was in the montage or at least they showed a zoo or something i m assuming he ate all the other animals but

so let me get this straight with army of the dead,the start of the film makes sense and is an interesting zombie premise up until they get to the hibernating zombies then it loses all sense chambers is being attacked by a few zombies and they just watch her getting attacked and eventually bitten it s revealed that martin was actually just there for the queen alpha head which brings up a whole other set of questions like why didn t they catch her as soon as they entered or used a net from a helicopter to catch it before to set off the vault traps they decide to use live zombies instead of the body parts and dead zombies to set the traps off by throwing them onto the pads of course it wouldn t be an awfully written film unless one of the main characters kate decide to leave the main group for an incredibly stupid reason geeta was incredibly likely to have died or been turned so why even bother looking for her in the first place rather than running to the rest of the team vanderohe and dieter decide to get more money when zombies are about to come through the roof of the elevator lily has a gun against the severed queen alpha s head to keep zeus away from them and instead of backing up towards the helicopter and throwing the head to distract him she walks the other way and gets killed going over to get kate which shouldn t have been an issue in the first place peters decides to fly off with the helicopter to waste time rather than staying on the roof so they could leave straight away zeus is able to board the helicopter and rather than deciding to just crash the damn thing peters starts to fly the main reason for the outbreak out of the quarantine and outside of the nuke radius meaning if they failed to kill him it would just continue to spread kate and ward survive a helicopter crash she waits for her dad to start to turn before killing him an army helicopter then finds her and most likely would have just killed any survivers in case they was carrying the infection vanderohe survives the nuke inside the safe meaning they all could have gone back to the safe and stayed there until the nuke hit not only does vanderohe survive the nuke he leaves the safe into a newly nuked area meaning he is being pummeled by radiation which surely would have killed him on the spot he s able to walk miles to settlement while heavily irradiated of course finds an unlocked car and decides to fly to mexico city and then realises he was bitten when you ve seen people turn almost straight away after being bittenthis could have been a genre defining movie with proper writing as i enjoyed the characters and wasn t expecting anyone to really survive to the end but pure stupidity shouldn t be of the deaths and the whole premise of the film being made redundant halfway through,netflix,so let me get this straight with army of the dead the start of the film makes sense and is an interesting zombie premise up until they get to the hibernating

queen alpha head which brings up a whole other set of questions like why didn t they catch her as soon as they entered or used a net from a helicopter to catch it before to set off the vault traps they decide to use live zombies instead of the body parts and dead zombies to set the traps off by throwing them onto the pads of course it wouldn t be an awfully written film unless one of the main characters kate decide to leave the main group for an incredibly stupid reason geeta was incredibly likely to have died or been turned so why even bother looking for her in the first place rather than running to the rest of the team vanderohe and dieter decide to get more money when zombies are about to come through the roof of the elevator lily has a gun against the severed queen alpha s head to keep zeus away from them and instead of backing up towards the helicopter and throwing the head to distract him she walks the other way and gets killed going over to get kate which shouldn t have been an issue in the first place peters decides to fly off with the helicopter to waste time rather than staying on the roof so they could leave straight away zeus is able to board the helicopter and rather than deciding to just crash the damn thing peters starts to fly the main reason for the outbreak out of the quarantine and outside of the nuke radius meaning if they failed to kill him it would just continue to spread kate and ward survive a helicopter crash she waits for her dad to start to turn before killing him an army helicopter then finds her and most likely would have just killed any survivers in case they was carrying the infection vanderohe survives the nuke inside the safe meaning they all could have gone back to the safe and stayed there until the nuke hit not only does vanderohe survive the nuke he leaves the safe into a newly nuked area meaning he is being pummeled by radiation which surely would have killed him on the spot he s able to walk miles to settlement while heavily irradiated of course finds an unlocked car and decides to fly to mexico city and then realises he was bitten when you ve seen people turn almost straight away after being bittenthis could have been a genre defining movie with proper writing as i enjoyed the characters and wasn t expecting anyone to really survive to the end but pure stupidity shouldn t be of the deaths and the whole premise of the film being made redundant halfway through
