the wilds had no criticism and this is bad ,we live in the day and age of echo chambers all the major media outlets are celebrating the show as the better version of lost due to amazon prime having content accessible only after a sub of course not all small web cinema critics make reviews so sometimes you find very few articles or videos online but this time the silence of criticism is kinda deafeningi wish here i can find someone else thay didn t appreciate the wilds but if not i wish at least that the conversation stays moderate and respectful spoilers this is what i didn t like gretchen is not a character she is a walking totem of third wave feminism all of her social commentary was not subtle in any way it was out in your face with the purpose of being annoying i am sorry but you can tame opinions but you can tame feelings my feeling was disgust premise i am atheist but i am sickened by the representation of religious people in the series it is the same story with life is strange if you are gamers religious people are always the bigots or the monsters in disguise i don t like that idea because religious people are humans too and they can vary on a wide scale of personality loud and abnoxius use of profanity that was always pulling me away it was so much incredibly abnoxius that it felt unreal gaining the opposite effect of what it should have i was fine with the lesbian loves they didn t feel forced like most stuff in the series but the love story in summer school in episode between one of the girls and that awkward kid it is just impossible i am mostly offended by that cause i had an awkward love story myself and i guarantee the best thing for me was to end it up put away the security blanket and mature the hell up the series instead tells you it is totally fine to give yourself to cringey relationships like that just cause they make you feel good oh plus as if it was needed the couple had to be interracial as that is the cool trend i am not saying you cant have interracial relationships displayed in a series but this was just a postcard for all the possible virtue signaling one can think of before some actual bigot call me racist i had a very long interracial relationship so stfu a long list of illogical things and inconsistencies i don t have the time to list and plot holes in general i think it is just the same series pandering to a certain audience that just likes to see progressive and brave imagery spouted over and over to deconstruct social expectations i can tell you the only thing it succeeded at deconstructing was my

basic review of amazon prime video s the report,from our marketing writer holly were you a fan of all the president s men you re gonna love this film the report is enthralling in its well report on the true story behind the senate intelligence committee s investigation into the legality ethics and effectiveness of the cia s enhanced intelligence aka torture program in particular it focuses on daniel jones the lead investigator and other staffers who spent years researching cia records compiling the report and working to bring it to light before the american public obviously with truth based narratives you should always question the views of the filmmakers and how their biases may affect how we view certain characters characters who happen to be real individuals in american politics and if you believe this film has a political bias i could understand the initial complaint the narrative focuses on the senate findings when it was led by senator diane feinstein a long serving democratic senatorbut the report challenges the misgivings of both the bush and obama administrations and how politics in general not a particular party muddled the waters of the investigation the film shows that key figures in both administrations were either complicit in the cia s actions or sought to make the information go away to save skin in truth the film s biggest villain is neither the republicans nor the democrats but rather the cia itself which the report shows has a checkered ethical history in its pursuit of national security for all americansas for the story itself the biggest general misgiving could be the pacing of the script this is a natural criticism for this type of narrative how do you make a real story that takes place over nearly a decade fit compactly into hours the writers did their best to make the script feel energetic by jumping from year to year but the use of flashbacks could confuse you on when in time the film is currently taking place if you re not paying attention despite its slow pacing the acting is compelling and adam driver in particular beings great charisma in his portrayal of jones and his desperation to seek justiceaside from the compelling narrative what i appreciate the most about this film is the streaming service that provides it note this is not an inherent endorsement of amazon however the service s format uses factoids that appear occasionally when one interacts with the cursor the factoids tell us who actors play what song is on in the background and interesting details about the film itself as someone who had no knowledge of politics when this story was happening i would have been in my teen years i found each factoid s extra information enlightening and gave additional context to the truth behind the filmnow is a heavy political time for all of us so you may not feel inclined to watch yet another film about the failures of our government and the justice system i get it i m right there with you but maybe that s why this film is timely in a time when we struggle to find the truth from our authoritative figures this film feels even more impactful the report the perfect film to watch to remind you to always question and consider those you hold above you and to seek the truth at all costs add in a great cast and you have a film sure to inspire healthy discussionwhat are your thoughts on the report

great charisma in his portrayal of jones and his desperation to seek justiceaside from the compelling narrative what i appreciate the most about this film is the streaming service that provides it note this is not an inherent endorsement of amazon however the service s format uses factoids that appear occasionally when one interacts with the cursor the factoids tell us who actors play what song is on in the background and interesting details about the film itself as someone who had no knowledge of politics when this story was happening i would have been in my teen years i found each factoid s extra information enlightening and gave additional context to the truth behind the filmnow is a heavy political time for all of us so you may not feel inclined to watch yet another film about the failures of our government and the justice system i get it i m right there with you but maybe that s why this film is timely in a time when we struggle to find the truth from our authoritative figures this film feels even more impactful the report the perfect film to watch to remind you to always question and consider those you hold above you and to seek the truth at all costs add in a great cast and you have a film sure to inspire healthy discussionwhat are your thoughts on the report let us know in the comments the shenandoah film collaborative in strasburg va
